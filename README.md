NGINX Reverse Proxies i use for my plex-seedboxes
Subdomains are intended for seperate subdomains before the domain.ltd like plex.domain.ltd are to be stored in nginx/sites-enabled folder
Subfolders are reverse proxies that trail behind a domain name and are intended to be stored in nginx/apps folder inside nginx
